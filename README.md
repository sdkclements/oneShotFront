We're using Hab's idea as a basis to build an anonymous message board, with an array of subtopic boards and easy submission. Users can create new topics, make posts on those topics, and reply to the posts. We're planning on having a very clean and simple interface.

User Stories
~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a user, I should be able to view all the available "tabs" (topics) on the homepage.

As a user, I should be able to create my own tabs with a title and a brief description.

As a user, I should be able to click a tab and see all of the "shots" (threads) for that tab.

As a user, I should be able to click a shot and see the author/author ID and all of the "chasers" (comments) on a separate view.

As a user, I should be able to add a chaser to any shot I'm viewing.
